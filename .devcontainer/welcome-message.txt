👋 Welcome to the "WebdriverIO Development Environment" in GitHub Codespaces!

🛠️  Your environment is fully setup with all the required software, so you can start making changes to the package files and test them.

There is a sample standalone script you can run via: '$ node ./examples/standalone/sample.js'

If you want to test changes for the testrunner (e.g. using Mocha), run:

$ cd ./examples/wdio
$ npm run test:mocha

🚀 Once the process in the terminals finish, following environments are available for you:
    - Preview of the documentation page: Open the portforwarded URL labelled with "Project Documentation"

    - Code Coverage Overview: Open the portforwarded URL labelled with "Code Coverage Site"
